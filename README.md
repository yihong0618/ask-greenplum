# Ask Greenplum Q&A


Greenplum Q&A is a project that demonstrates how to use word embeddings and Postgres to build a chatbot. The chatbot is implemented using pgvector and relies on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API to generate responses.

## Getting started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have:

- A Neon account, and project.
- an API key for the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API, which you can obtain from https://openai.com/.

Once you have the prerequisites installed, follow these steps to get the project up and running:

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yihong0618/ask-greenplum/.git
cd ask-greenplum
```

## Prepare the data

```bash
cd data
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Import the schema to your database:

```bash
psql <database-url> -f database.sql
```

Letâ€™s now add `DATABASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` to our environment variables:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_NEON_CONEECTION_STRING> OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
```

pgvector 
```
docker run --name some-greenplum1 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432  -d ankane/pgvector
```


Run `main.py` to import the emebbeding to your Neon database:

```bash
python main.py
```

Relax and grab a cup of coffee as this section might take 10min to process!

Expcted result:

```bash
Saving to CSV...
Loading tokenizer...
Embedding text...
Connecting to database...
Done!
```


Set the following environment variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY= Your OpenAI API key.
DATABASE_URL= The connection URL for your docker postgres database.
```
